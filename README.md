#QUIZ 8 EXERCISES:

#Exercise 1 
#A few weeks ago you submitted a data set and associated question(s). Create a Github repository as we did this week with the inside of the class organization named “lastname-wordrelatedtodata”. Include a script that reads in data locally or from url. In the Readme file describe the dataset and primary question you have regarding it.
#..................................................................................
#Exercise 2 
#In the Readme file for your new repo, write the a general plan on how you might begin to tackle the question and explore the data. This should be very general (not code).
#...................................................................................

#For this exercise, I will be using this dataset from the Washington Department of Ecology to see how water quality during the summer of 2016. This was at the tail-end of a few summers of harmful algal bloom outbreaks, so I want to see how water quality was different in a few areas of the Puget Sound. In order to do this, I will download the data and filter out all the areas so that I am left with three areas of focus. I will plot water quality indicators, such as pH levels, for the 2016 summer datasets and look at the variability across the different areas during the same time. Since I have to download the location datasets separately from the website, I will filter out the non-relevant datas from the datasets and then combine them into a single dataset, with each of the sites in one dataset.


Exercise 3 
Using the Issues feature in GitHub, create an issue where you suggest something interesting to explore in your classmates repositories.

Exercise 4 
In the repository you created, begin to tackle the question you posed. Minimally you should create a modified data table / object and at least one figure summarizes the data or directly addresses your question.


Exercise 5 
In at least 3 other repositories created this week make a suggested R code edit that generates a) summary information of the given data set and b) a new plot or revision to current plot.


Exercise 6 (Optional) 
At any time you have a question on how you might go about accomplishing a task in R create a new Issue in the given repository.
